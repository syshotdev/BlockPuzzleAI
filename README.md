This is just another side project I thought of. Me and my friends started playing this game called "Block Puzzle", and I thought it was a very simple game so I tried recreating it from scratch... With the intention of an AI playing it.
Currently, no compiled version, UI sucks, looks horrible, very slow, and the score of the AI is abysmal. (Like 200-500, in game I get like 5000 usually).
To run it, use Godot. I think like 4.1 or 4.2 will work, and to make the AI make a decision you press the right arrow key.
It's supposed to work like the AI's of Chess bots, where every move is calculated rather than just being trained on a dataset.
It does work, but the only goal is to clear lines. It doesn't look very far into the future, so that's a problem.
