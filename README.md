This is just another side project I thought of. Me and my friends started playing this game called "Block Puzzle", and I thought it was a very simple game so I tried recreating it from scratch... With the intention of an AI playing it.
Currently, no compiled version, UI sucks, looks horrible, very slow, and the score of the AI is abysmal. (Like 200-500, in game I get like 5000 usually).
To run it, use Godot. I think like 4.1 or 4.2 will work, and to make the AI make a decision you press the right arrow key.
It's supposed to work like the AI's of Chess bots, where every move is calculated far into the future to see if it's the right move to take now.
It does work, but the only goal is to clear lines, and nothing else. It doesn't look very far into the future for moves, as it slows to a snail crawl when above 5M moves.
My goal is to crush my friend's score by over ~3000 points, friend's score being 12000. Can you beat the AI?
